# What Copilot Generated

Several parts of my script were initially generated by Copilot. 
For example, when I wrote a comment such as “# function to clean column names”, 
Copilot automatically suggested a full function that converted column names to 
lowercase and replaced spaces with underscores. I also typed a short prompt like 
“# remove negative values from numeric columns”, and Copilot generated a loop that
attempted to filter them out. In addition, when I added comments describing user 
input or printing a summary, Copilot often auto-completed entire blocks of code
based on those brief descriptions.

#  What I Modified

Although Copilot’s suggestions were a helpful starting point, I needed to adjust 
several things. I renamed variables to make them clearer, since Copilot sometimes
used vague names like data or temp. I also added extra logic to strip leading and 
trailing whitespace from strings because Copilot didn’t include that step. These
changes were necessary to improve clarity, maintainability, and accuracy.

# What I Learned

This project helped me understand best practices in data cleaning, such as consistently
formatting column names, validating input, and checking for unusual values. I also 
learned that Copilot is excellent for generating quick boilerplate code or giving me
a starting point when I’m unsure how to structure a function. However, I noticed that 
it sometimes makes assumptions about my data or produces code that is more complex than
needed. Overall, I learned that Copilot is a strong assistant, but I still need to 
review, edit, and understand the code to ensure it works correctly.
